# Discernment

## Principles of Discernment 1
*John McArther*

- Your life is the by product of you choices
- What are the criteria to make the choices you need to make
- What is the greatest need in the church today. Discernment.
- The man with the vast library of religious books.  "There's good in all of it"
  - His wife with a quilt with no color scheme or pattern. A representation of her husband's theology.
- How dare you question anyone's view? What we face today
- The Christian Church is fighting for it's life.
  - It's better for Chrisitans to shed their blood than compromise
  - A persecuted church clings with tenaciy to the truth
  - A comfortable church easily abandons the church

- Two systems. The truth and the lie.
  - God loves the truth.
  - We must be able to discern between the truth and the lie.
