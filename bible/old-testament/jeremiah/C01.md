> 1 The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin.
> 2 The word of the Lord came to him in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah, 3 and through the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, down to the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, when the people of Jerusalem went into exile.

> Well done good and "faithful" servant. NOT fruitful

- Jeremiah was born during the reign of Manasseh who was one of the worst kings
  - People being murdered on the streets
  - Children being offered as sacrifice to idols
  - He was born in that wickedness

>
>   5 “Before I formed you in the womb I knew[a] you,
>      before you were born I set you apart;
>      I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”
