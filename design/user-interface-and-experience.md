1. Beauty comes second
  - Plenty of websites with terrible UI
    - Craigslist
    - Amazon
    - Reddit

1. Make users feel smart
1. Familiarity = Speedy learning


## 4 Steps to Build a UI/UX Experience

1. Narrow your scope
  - Identifies a narrow band of target users (specifically your first adopters)
  - Speeds up development time
  - Guides testing
  - Gives marketing individuals early insight into user acquisition strategies
  - Narrows down number of variables for testing
  - Saves money

- Amazon: started as an online book seller
- Google: started #12 in search engine race
- Twitter: SMS messaging platform

- Steps
  - Fill out: (Product) is a (general, relatable tool) that allows (2 adjectives + target users) to (use case)
  - Define personas(be specific)
    - Barabara is a Mom living in West Hill's who likes to ride bikes..."
  - Check yourself
    - Storyboard
    - Use your personas
    - Identify dead ends

2. Build
  - Tools you need to know
  - HTML5
  - Heroku
  - Keynotopia
  - Balsamic
  - Flurry
  - Heap
  - Mailchimp
  - 99 Designs
  - Hockey App
  - Hubspot

3. Simplify
  - Don't oversimplify
  - Add elements to see how users interact and then simplify based on response
> "Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex and more violent.  It takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction."
> Albert Einstein

  - Identify activity pathways

Prioritize activity pathways
- What's going to make you money
- What pathways do you need users to engage with most?
- What pathways do users currently do most?
- How can you modify the UX to 2 paths above?
