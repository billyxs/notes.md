### Elmore Leonard's Rules For Writers

1. Never open a book with weather.
1. Avoid prologues: they can be annoying, especially a prologue following an introduction that comes after a foreword.
1. Never use a verbo other than "said" to carry dialogue. The line of dialogue belongs to the character; the verb is the writer sticking his nose in.
1. Never use an adverb to modify the verb "said"... "he admonished gravely".
1. Keep your exclamations points under control. You are allowed not more than two or three per 100,000 words of prose.
1. Never use the words "suddenly" or "all hell broke loose". The rule doesn't require an explanation.
1. User regional dialect, patios, sparingly. One you start spelling words in a dialogue phonetically and loading the page with apostrophes, you won't be able to stop.
1. Avoid detailed descriptions of characters, which Steinbeck covered.
1. Don't go into great detail describing places and things, unless you're Margaret Atwood and can paint pictures with languange.
1. Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip.  Think of what you skip reading a novel: thick paragraphs of prose you can see have too many words in them.

_My most rule - if it sounds like writing, I rewrite it_
