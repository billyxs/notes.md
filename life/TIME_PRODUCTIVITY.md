## These Are The Long Term Effects Of Multitasking

https://www.fastcompany.com/3057192/these-are-the-long-term-effects-of-multitasking

*Being constantly connected may keep you from getting fired, but making time for deep work is what will get you promoted.*

> “Shallow tasks like reading and responding to emails or checking social media might prevent you from getting fired, but it’s deep tasks that produce the value and build the skills that get you promoted.”

>  it’s the bouncing around from task to task, or multitasking, that deteriorates the muscle allowing you to focus. And the more you multitask, the less comfortable you’ll be “going deep for extended periods of time,”

### How Multitasking is Addictive and Damaging

- Multitasking is damaging to our brain
- Research studies concluded that our brains are actually “dumbed down” while multitasking.

- Subjects who multitasked experienced drops in their IQ comparable to someone who missed a night of sleep. - A study at the University Of London
- Even if multitaskers feel like they’re getting more done
  - They’re working at a much lower cognitive level
  - Costing companies billions of dollars in lost productivity.

- If you’re a multitasker, you might have done some serious permanent damage
  -  Study of MRI scans on the brains of multitaskers found they had less brain density in areas that controlled empathy and emotions.
  - Multitaskers become addicted to the instant gratification that comes after completing a small task, like sending an email.
    - Leads to a dangerous feedback loop that leaves you believing you’re producing at optimal rate, but this is deceptive.
  - It is difficult for people to transition their attention away from an unfinished task, and their subsequent task performance suffers.

### Attention Residue
- “Attention residue” occurs, which is when you’re thinking of one task even though you’ve supposedly already moved on to the next.
- The more residue buildup you have, the worst you’ll perform on all tasks.
- Just knowing an unread email is sitting in your inbox can reduce a multitasker’s IQ by 10 points.

### Rebuilding the Brain
*So how does one break the destructive cycle?*

> Newport suggests this is where “deep work” comes in, which is “when you focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task,” he told Fast Company. “For an effort to be considered deep work—and for it to reap the rewards depth can offer—there can be no distraction.”

- The best students aren’t the ones who study more, but actually the ones who can study for uninterrupted stretches.
- By maximizing the intensity and concentration of your work, you can maximize the high quality of the work they produce.

> “High-quality work produced is a function of two things—the amount of time you spend on the work and the intensity of your focus during this time,” said Newport.
> “If you can increase your focus, you’ll get more done in less time.”
> The ability to perform deep work requires training. Not only do you need to practice challenging your mind, but you also need to wean yourself off an addiction to distraction. I suggest, for example, scheduling the times outside of work when you will use your phone or tablet, and then put the technology away outside those times. In other words, you need many hours every day where you’re a little bit bored.

## Why We Like Distractions

https://ia.net/topics/distractions-and-how-to-fight-them/

> When we need to get something done, we are most vulnerable to distractions. How Come? And What can we do about it?

+ Distractions delay the moment of truth where we need to show who we really are. Getting started is particularly hard.

+ We ultimately don't want to face others and ultimately ourselves. We procrastinate to protect ourselves.

+ We might get rejected, no response, our idea is not as good as we hoped.
+ While we procrastinate, others advance.
+ The only way to fight that fear is focus. Starting and finishing take courage.
+ Focus on the job, forget about yourself. It's about getting the job done.
+ Avoid busy apps, loud environments, distracting habits and people that give you an excuse to waste time.

> Once you've started, the hardest part is behind you. You build something, rework it, refine it.  It gets better the more time, courage, and devotion you put in.



## Why you should be time blocking and not just writing to-do lists

_Reference: https://www.fastcompany.com/3057192/these-are-the-long-term-effects-of-multitasking_

> Tim blocking is the practice of scheduling cetain periods of time in which to tackle specific tasks. During these time blocks, you focus on only one project or task at a time.

> This doesn't work if you allow any interruptions or distractions.

### When we should time-block

> Cal Newport, an Associate Professor of computer science at Georgetown University and author of the wildly popular “Deep Work”, argues that time away from distraction is necessary to enter a state of deep work.

> Many great thinkers shut themselves off from society when they needed to focus or meet a tough deadline. J.K. Rowling would rent a hotel room, Carl Jung built a tower in the woods to get away.

> Humans as social creatures like to participate in conversations around us. Time-blocking gives you “permission” to ignore those conversations and messages for a period of time in order to get down to work.

### Quality = Time x Focus

> “high-quality work produced is a function of two things — the amount of time you spend on the work and the intensity of your focus during this time. If you can increase your focus, you’ll get more done in less time.” - Cal Newport

> “the average knowledge worker switches tasks every three minutes, and, once distracted, a worker can take nearly a half-hour to resume the original task” - Gloria Mark


### How to time-block

> Schedule blocks of time for certain activities

> Schedule blocks for as long or as short as you like. You can be as specific or non-specific as you like.

> Be strict with not allowing distractions

> Techniques: "Getting things done" or Pomodoro

> Don't overschedule yourself.

> Make sure to schedule breaks for yourself, and be flexible enough to realize when you’re not feeling up to a certain task.

### What if...

+ What if answering messages and calls is part of your job? - Schedule when you will answer messages
+ What if you’re expected to be available at all times? The pressure to answer immediately these days is real - Communicate what you are trying to do get certain work done.
+

### Effects of time blocking

> During research for his book, Cal Newport found that a side effect of setting out distinct time periods to focus was that people were actually happier.
> Not only were they more productive, but they felt better about the work they were doing, and more satisfied with their jobs overall.
