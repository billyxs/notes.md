> We navigate life behind the confines of computers and smart phones. Social media has alterted the way we interact. Through technology and culture, we have developed the ability to sit in a crowded room and mentally "check out", unaware of what is going on around us.

> Advances in technology have allowed us to connect and build relationships with people all over the world and enable companies to run more efficiently. On the other hand, it may be interfering with our ability to learn effective social skills that are necessary for navigating health relationships.

> Harvard study claim successful college graduates must possess a ratio of 80% emotional-social intelligence to 20% book smarts. Today's college grads are less empathetic and more narcisistic than grads from the 1980-90s.

> In a world of increased narcissism and a decreased capacity to effectively read people, how can we discern genuine, authentic people from narcissistic manipulators?  How can we challenge our perceptions and not automatically believe the artificially perfected information that is presented in our newsfeeds?

> So as a manager, what’s the best way to instill grit and grace in your team? My research shows that it’s about cultivating three specific emotions: gratitude, compassion, and pride...These three emotions not only increase patience and perseverance, but also build social bonds.

> People who express gratitude, compassion, and pride are viewed positively by those around them.

> People made to feel pride or compassion are willing to persevere more than 30% longer on challenging tasks compared to those feeling other positive emotions, such as happiness, precisely because pride and compassion induce them to place greater value on future rewards.

> Unlike using willpower to keep your nose to the grindstone, using these emotions also helps solve an increasingly common problem of professional life: loneliness.

> Compassion, too, builds dedication. ...those who worked in units characterized by higher feelings of social attachment, trust, acceptance, and support—a composite that could easily be called empathy and compassion—not only showed superior performance and engagement, but also increased work satisfaction, less exhaustion, and lower absenteeism.
