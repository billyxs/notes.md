> So as a manager, what’s the best way to instill grit and grace in your team? My research shows that it’s about cultivating three specific emotions: gratitude, compassion, and pride...These three emotions not only increase patience and perseverance, but also build social bonds.

> People who express gratitude, compassion, and pride are viewed positively by those around them.

> People made to feel pride or compassion are willing to persevere more than 30% longer on challenging tasks compared to those feeling other positive emotions, such as happiness, precisely because pride and compassion induce them to place greater value on future rewards.

> Unlike using willpower to keep your nose to the grindstone, using these emotions also helps solve an increasingly common problem of professional life: loneliness.

> Compassion, too, builds dedication. ...those who worked in units characterized by higher feelings of social attachment, trust, acceptance, and support—a composite that could easily be called empathy and compassion—not only showed superior performance and engagement, but also increased work satisfaction, less exhaustion, and lower absenteeism.
