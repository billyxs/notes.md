## Amazon's 12 Leadership Principles
https://www.amazon.jobs/principles

We use our Leadership Principles every day, whether we're discussing ideas for new projects or deciding on the best approach to solving a problem. It is just one of the things that makes Amazon peculiar.

- Customer Obsession
  - Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
- Ownership
  - Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job".

- Invent and Simplify
  - Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

- Are Right, A Lot
  - Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

- Learn and Be Curious
  - Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

- Hire and Develop the Best
  - Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

- Insist on the Highest Standards
  - Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

- Think Big
  - Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

- Bias for Action
  - Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

- Frugality
  - Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.

- Earn Trust
  - Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

- Dive Deep
  - Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

- Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
  - Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

- Deliver Results
  - Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

## 12 Traits of Truly Authentic People

https://blogs.psychcentral.com/success-workplace/2018/02/dont-be-fooled-by-smoke-and-mirrors-12-traits-of-truly-authentic-people/

> We navigate life behind the confines of computers and smart phones. Social media has alterted the way we interact. Through technology and culture, we have developed the ability to sit in a crowded room and mentally "check out", unaware of what is going on around us.

> Advances in technology have allowed us to connect and build relationships with people all over the world and enable companies to run more efficiently. On the other hand, it may be interfering with our ability to learn effective social skills that are necessary for navigating health relationships.

> Harvard study claim successful college graduates must possess a ratio of 80% emotional-social intelligence to 20% book smarts. Today's college grads are less empathetic and more narcisistic than grads from the 1980-90s.

> In a world of increased narcissism and a decreased capacity to effectively read people, how can we discern genuine, authentic people from narcissistic manipulators?  How can we challenge our perceptions and not automatically believe the artificially perfected information that is presented in our newsfeeds?

## How to Cultivate Gratitude, Compassion, and Pride on Your Team
https://hbr.org/2018/02/how-to-cultivate-gratitude-compassion-and-pride-on-your-team

> So as a manager, what’s the best way to instill grit and grace in your team? My research shows that it’s about cultivating three specific emotions: gratitude, compassion, and pride...These three emotions not only increase patience and perseverance, but also build social bonds.

> People who express gratitude, compassion, and pride are viewed positively by those around them.

> People made to feel pride or compassion are willing to persevere more than 30% longer on challenging tasks compared to those feeling other positive emotions, such as happiness, precisely because pride and compassion induce them to place greater value on future rewards.

> Unlike using willpower to keep your nose to the grindstone, using these emotions also helps solve an increasingly common problem of professional life: loneliness.

> Compassion, too, builds dedication. ...those who worked in units characterized by higher feelings of social attachment, trust, acceptance, and support—a composite that could easily be called empathy and compassion—not only showed superior performance and engagement, but also increased work satisfaction, less exhaustion, and lower absenteeism.

## Agile Is Dead

GOTO 2015 Agile is Dead - by Pragmatic Dave Thomas

[Agile is Dead - Pragmatic Dave Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M)


### 1999 Development

- UML - Unified Modeling Language
  - ~"Total focus on classes rather than objects probably destroyed object oriented language"
- RUP - Rational Unified Process
- Experiments with extreme programming
- Ideas around Adaptive Software Development


### The Manifesto For Agile Software Development
_unfortunately people call it "The Agile Manifesto"_

http://agilemanifesto.org/

- Agile is an adjective, not a noun
  - an agile gymnast
  - an agile programmer
  - an agile methodology

- Agile is not a noun. You cannot do Agile. It's not a proper noun like God.

### Nouns Sell
- Fear is used to sell, like medicene
  - New words
  - New roles
  - New ways to measure
  - Are we doing it right?
- Cool Sells
  - Bright and shiny
  - Feeling of power
  - What, you aren't doing Agile?


People like to feel like they know something others don't know. It can be a sense of power. That they hold some sort of special knowlege that you don't.

#### Ruby community and testing
- "You don't have 100% test coverage? You call yourself a programmer?"

> I'm probably shunned by the Ruby community because I don't do tests. The same thing happens in the Agile community. We can put people down that don't do things our way. Our way is best.

**Agile is an industry**
- It's a machine that taxes on the basis of fear. To pay money to aswage that fear.
- "The world is adopting SCRUM, are you?" - Ad
- Agile was built for small teams, but the money is in corporations
  - Nesting agile...

### It's time to reclaim agility

#### Agility - What to do
1. Find out where you are.
1. Take a small step towards your goal. Understand where you want to be.
1. Adjust your understanding base on what you learned.
1. Repeat

#### Agility - How to do it
1. When faced with two of more alternatives that deliver roughly the same value, take the path that makes future change easier.

> A good design is easier to change than a bad design. Make decisions that are easier to change in the future.

#### PID Controller - Proportional Integral Derivative

- Example: Robot that balances itself with pendulums
- Used in heating, cars, large boats

#### No Rules are Universal - All Rules Need Context
Any book that says "This is how you write software" is wrong. It does not know how your team works.

> How do you know what to do?

In any situation where you don't know what is going to happen next.
- Find out where you are
- Take a small step towards your goal
- Adjust your understandings based on what you learned
- Repeat

- When faced with two of more alternatives that deliver roughly the same value, take the path that makes future change easier.

> Not just an agile project, and agile life

**Courage - Stand up to fear-mongers**

You already have the values - use them to create practices. Get feedback, refine, repeat.

> Agile is not what you. Agility is how you do it.
