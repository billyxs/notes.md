## Six Verbs That Make You Sound Weak No Matter Your Job Title
https://www.fastcompany.com/40523559/six-verbs-that-make-you-sound-weak-no-matter-your-job-title

- Overusing weak verbs can make you sound weaker
- Weak verbs undercut your ability to inspire others
- Weak verbs make you sound unsure of yourself

- The list
  - **Think**
    - It's not definitive enough
    - Subtly suggests your still considering the position and are not sure of it
    - "I think..." is a throwaway phrase
  - **Need**
    - Conjures up a feeling of dependency
    - "I need" makes you sound needy
    - Makes requests sound like you're pleading
  - **Want**
    - Similar to **Need**
    - "I want you to improve..." Suggests you aren't getting what you want
    - "I want a raise" is an emotional appeal and signals a lack of confidence
  - **Guess**
    - Conveys tentativeness
    - If you aren't sure, that's fine. Don't lie or exaggerate
    - Rather than guess, use the most confident expression you can
  - **Hope**
    - Suggests that the speaker has little control over the outcome
      - "I hope we get the sale"
    - Use empowering statements like, "I know we will give it our all"
  - **Suppose**
    - Quietly indicates it doesn't really matter to you - you are not really engaged
    - There's no occasion in the workplace where conveying your indifference and inertia will improve you influence and authority.
    - Find something to express you passion for.


## 12 Traits of Truly Authentic People

> We navigate life behind the confines of computers and smart phones. Social media has alterted the way we interact. Through technology and culture, we have developed the ability to sit in a crowded room and mentally "check out", unaware of what is going on around us.

> Advances in technology have allowed us to connect and build relationships with people all over the world and enable companies to run more efficiently. On the other hand, it may be interfering with our ability to learn effective social skills that are necessary for navigating health relationships.

> Harvard study claim successful college graduates must possess a ratio of 80% emotional-social intelligence to 20% book smarts. Today's college grads are less empathetic and more narcisistic than grads from the 1980-90s.

> In a world of increased narcissism and a decreased capacity to effectively read people, how can we discern genuine, authentic people from narcissistic manipulators?  How can we challenge our perceptions and not automatically believe the artificially perfected information that is presented in our newsfeeds?

## How to Cultivate Gratitude, Compassion, and Pride on Your Team
https://hbr.org/2018/02/how-to-cultivate-gratitude-compassion-and-pride-on-your-team

> So as a manager, what’s the best way to instill grit and grace in your team? My research shows that it’s about cultivating three specific emotions: gratitude, compassion, and pride...These three emotions not only increase patience and perseverance, but also build social bonds.

> People who express gratitude, compassion, and pride are viewed positively by those around them.

> People made to feel pride or compassion are willing to persevere more than 30% longer on challenging tasks compared to those feeling other positive emotions, such as happiness, precisely because pride and compassion induce them to place greater value on future rewards.

> Unlike using willpower to keep your nose to the grindstone, using these emotions also helps solve an increasingly common problem of professional life: loneliness.

> Compassion, too, builds dedication. ...those who worked in units characterized by higher feelings of social attachment, trust, acceptance, and support—a composite that could easily be called empathy and compassion—not only showed superior performance and engagement, but also increased work satisfaction, less exhaustion, and lower absenteeism.

## Agile Is Dead

GOTO 2015 Agile is Dead - by Pragmatic Dave Thomas

[Agile is Dead - Pragmatic Dave Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M)


### 1999 Development

- UML - Unified Modeling Language
  - ~"Total focus on classes rather than objects probably destroyed object oriented language"
- RUP - Rational Unified Process
- Experiments with extreme programming
- Ideas around Adaptive Software Development


### The Manifesto For Agile Software Development
_unfortunately people call it "The Agile Manifesto"_

http://agilemanifesto.org/

- Agile is an adjective, not a noun
  - an agile gymnast
  - an agile programmer
  - an agile methodology

- Agile is not a noun. You cannot do Agile. It's not a proper noun like God.

### Nouns Sell
- Fear is used to sell, like medicene
  - New words
  - New roles
  - New ways to measure
  - Are we doing it right?
- Cool Sells
  - Bright and shiny
  - Feeling of power
  - What, you aren't doing Agile?


People like to feel like they know something others don't know. It can be a sense of power. That they hold some sort of special knowlege that you don't.

#### Ruby community and testing
- "You don't have 100% test coverage? You call yourself a programmer?"

> I'm probably shunned by the Ruby community because I don't do tests. The same thing happens in the Agile community. We can put people down that don't do things our way. Our way is best.

**Agile is an industry**
- It's a machine that taxes on the basis of fear. To pay money to aswage that fear.
- "The world is adopting SCRUM, are you?" - Ad
- Agile was built for small teams, but the money is in corporations
  - Nesting agile...

### It's time to reclaim agility

#### Agility - What to do
1. Find out where you are.
1. Take a small step towards your goal. Understand where you want to be.
1. Adjust your understanding base on what you learned.
1. Repeat

#### Agility - How to do it
1. When faced with two of more alternatives that deliver roughly the same value, take the path that makes future change easier.

> A good design is easier to change than a bad design. Make decisions that are easier to change in the future.

#### PID Controller - Proportional Integral Derivative

- Example: Robot that balances itself with pendulums
- Used in heating, cars, large boats

#### No Rules are Universal - All Rules Need Context
Any book that says "This is how you write software" is wrong. It does not know how your team works.

> How do you know what to do?

In any situation where you don't know what is going to happen next.
- Find out where you are
- Take a small step towards your goal
- Adjust your understandings based on what you learned
- Repeat

- When faced with two of more alternatives that deliver roughly the same value, take the path that makes future change easier.

> Not just an agile project, and agile life

**Courage - Stand up to fear-mongers**

You already have the values - use them to create practices. Get feedback, refine, repeat.

> Agile is not what you. Agility is how you do it.
