**Characteristics of a Well System**
+ Hire people who like to work hard and who have something to prove.
+ Encourage people to own and manage large blocks of their own time, and give people time to think and make thinking part of the job—not extra.
+ Let people rest. Encourage them to go home at sensible times. If they work late give them time off to make up for it.
+ Aim for consistency. Set emotional boundaries and expectations, be clear about rewards, and protect people where possible from crises so they can plan their time.
+ Make their success their own and credit them for it.
+ Don’t promise happiness. Promise fair pay and good work.
