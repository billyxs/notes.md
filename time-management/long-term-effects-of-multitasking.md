*Being constantly connected may keep you from getting fired, but making time for deep work is what will get you promoted.*

> “Shallow tasks like reading and responding to emails or checking social media might prevent you from getting fired, but it’s deep tasks that produce the value and build the skills that get you promoted.”

>  it’s the bouncing around from task to task, or multitasking, that deteriorates the muscle allowing you to focus. And the more you multitask, the less comfortable you’ll be “going deep for extended periods of time,”

### How Multitasking is Addictive and Damaging

- Multitasking is damaging to our brain
- Research studies concluded that our brains are actually “dumbed down” while multitasking.

- Subjects who multitasked experienced drops in their IQ comparable to someone who missed a night of sleep. - A study at the University Of London
- Even if multitaskers feel like they’re getting more done
  - They’re working at a much lower cognitive level
  - Costing companies billions of dollars in lost productivity.

- If you’re a multitasker, you might have done some serious permanent damage
  -  Study of MRI scans on the brains of multitaskers found they had less brain density in areas that controlled empathy and emotions.
  - Multitaskers become addicted to the instant gratification that comes after completing a small task, like sending an email.
    - Leads to a dangerous feedback loop that leaves you believing you’re producing at optimal rate, but this is deceptive.
  - It is difficult for people to transition their attention away from an unfinished task, and their subsequent task performance suffers.

### Attention Residue
- “Attention residue” occurs, which is when you’re thinking of one task even though you’ve supposedly already moved on to the next.
- The more residue buildup you have, the worst you’ll perform on all tasks.
- Just knowing an unread email is sitting in your inbox can reduce a multitasker’s IQ by 10 points.

### Rebuilding the Brain
*So how does one break the destructive cycle?*

> Newport suggests this is where “deep work” comes in, which is “when you focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task,” he told Fast Company. “For an effort to be considered deep work—and for it to reap the rewards depth can offer—there can be no distraction.”

- The best students aren’t the ones who study more, but actually the ones who can study for uninterrupted stretches.
- By maximizing the intensity and concentration of your work, you can maximize the high quality of the work they produce.

> “High-quality work produced is a function of two things—the amount of time you spend on the work and the intensity of your focus during this time,” said Newport.
> “If you can increase your focus, you’ll get more done in less time.”
> The ability to perform deep work requires training. Not only do you need to practice challenging your mind, but you also need to wean yourself off an addiction to distraction. I suggest, for example, scheduling the times outside of work when you will use your phone or tablet, and then put the technology away outside those times. In other words, you need many hours every day where you’re a little bit bored.
