# Why We Like Distractions

https://ia.net/topics/distractions-and-how-to-fight-them/

> When we need to get something done, we are most vulnerable to distractions. How Come? And What can we do about it?

- Distractions delay the moment of truth where we need to show who we really are. Getting started is particularly hard.

- We ultimately don't want to face others and ultimately ourselves. We procrastinate to protect ourselves.

- We might get rejected, no response, our idea is not as good as we hoped.
- While we procrastinate, others advance.
- The only way to fight that fear is focus. Starting and finishing take courage.
- Focus on the job, forget about yourself. It's about getting the job done.
- Avoid busy apps, loud environments, distracting habits and people that give you an excuse to waste time.

> Once you've started, the hardest part is behind you. You build something, rework it, refine it.  It gets better the more time, courage, and devotion you put in.
