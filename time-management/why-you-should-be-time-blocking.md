> Tim blocking is the practice of scheduling cetain periods of time in which to tackle specific tasks. During these time blocks, you focus on only one project or task at a time.

> This doesn't work if you allow any interruptions or distractions.

### When we should time-block

> Cal Newport, an Associate Professor of computer science at Georgetown University and author of the wildly popular “Deep Work”, argues that time away from distraction is necessary to enter a state of deep work.

> Many great thinkers shut themselves off from society when they needed to focus or meet a tough deadline. J.K. Rowling would rent a hotel room, Carl Jung built a tower in the woods to get away.

> Humans as social creatures like to participate in conversations around us. Time-blocking gives you “permission” to ignore those conversations and messages for a period of time in order to get down to work.

### Quality = Time x Focus

> “high-quality work produced is a function of two things — the amount of time you spend on the work and the intensity of your focus during this time. If you can increase your focus, you’ll get more done in less time.” - Cal Newport

> “the average knowledge worker switches tasks every three minutes, and, once distracted, a worker can take nearly a half-hour to resume the original task” - Gloria Mark


### How to time-block

> Schedule blocks of time for certain activities

> Schedule blocks for as long or as short as you like. You can be as specific or non-specific as you like.

> Be strict with not allowing distractions

> Techniques: "Getting things done" or Pomodoro

> Don't overschedule yourself.

> Make sure to schedule breaks for yourself, and be flexible enough to realize when you’re not feeling up to a certain task.

### What if...

+ What if answering messages and calls is part of your job? - Schedule when you will answer messages
+ What if you’re expected to be available at all times? The pressure to answer immediately these days is real - Communicate what you are trying to do get certain work done.

### Effects of time blocking

> During research for his book, Cal Newport found that a side effect of setting out distinct time periods to focus was that people were actually happier.
> Not only were they more productive, but they felt better about the work they were doing, and more satisfied with their jobs overall.
